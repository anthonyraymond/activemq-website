## Project Activity:

#### ActiveMQ Artemis
- The 2.29.0 release is almost ready for a vote. It will include a handful
  of bug-fixes and dependency upgrades, along with work to allow building
  on JDK20, and significantly reduce memory usage in test runs. The most
  notable new feature is that now "connector" definitions added via the
  management API are durable.

#### ActiveMQ Classic
- ActiveMQ 5.18.0 released, with major updates including initial JMS 2.0
  support, and also initial client-only support for Jakarta Messaging 3.1 to
  enable usage with Spring 6.
- ActiveMQ 5.18.1 is currently under vote to fix activemq-client-jakarta.
- Planning is underway for how the broker can be updated to support Jakarta
  Messaging as well to allow embedding, tentatively targeted for 5.19.x.
