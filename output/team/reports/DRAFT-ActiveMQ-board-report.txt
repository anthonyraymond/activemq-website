## Project Activity:

#### ActiveMQ Artemis
- 2.30.0 released, mainly bug fixes with a handful of small improvements
  and dependency upgrades.
- 2.31.0 released, with various bug fixes and notable improvements such as
  AMQP-based federation, broker CLI enhancements around a shell mode, MQTT
  session persistence, and JDBC paging performance.
- Work is now progressing towards 2.32.0.

#### ActiveMQ "Classic"
- ActiveMQ 5.17.5 and 5.18.2 bug fix releases were made, with work
  continuing on more fixes and updates toward future such releases.
- Work progresses around using Jakarta Messaging on the mainline broker etc
  to allow use of embedded brokers with newer Jakarta applications, and
  also moving to using Spring 6, and requiring JDK 17+.
- In consideration of the above mainline changes it was proposed and decided
  to re-version the main branch from 5.19.0-SNAPSHOT to 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT to
  better separate the two release streams and facilitate supporting users of
  both new + old APIs and dependencies via future 5.x and 6.x releases.

#### ActiveMQ NMS API
- ActiveMQ NMS API 2.1.0 was released to facilitate client work on
  asynchronous task based message delivery within consuming applications.
