#### ActiveMQ Artemis
 - The 2.29.0 release is almost ready for a vote. It includes a handful of bug-fixes and dependency upgrades. The most notable new feature is that now "connector" definitions added via the management API are durable.

#### ActiveMQ Classic
We are preparing ActiveMQ 5.17.4, a maintenance release including important fixes.
In the meantime, we are also working on 5.18.0 release preparation, which is an important milestone for ActiveMQ with major updates (Jakarta namespace, JMS 2 preview/client, ...).
