#### ActiveMQ Artemis
 - We've had three releases since the last report with the main updates being a new logging API & implementation, paging improvements, and a new option to synchronize operations on a broker's mirror.
 - The roadmap for 2.29.0 isn't yet clear since 2.28.0 just dropped a few days ago.
 - Migrations to Artemis appear to have accelerated a bit with the release of Spring Boot 3.0.

#### ActiveMQ Classic
We are preparing ActiveMQ 5.17.4, a maintenance release including important fixes.
In the meantime, we are also working on 5.18.0 release preparation, which is an important milestone for ActiveMQ with major updates (Jakarta namespace, JMS 2 preview/client, ...).
