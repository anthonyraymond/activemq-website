## Project Activity:
### ActiveMQ
##### A JIRA clean-up closed stale tickets, resulting in about 1/2 as many open
    tickets (approx 441)
##### ActiveMQ 5.16.4 released, this is a maintenance release; fixing issue
     and switching to reload4j instead of log4j1 fixing several security
     issues.
##### ActiveMQ 5.17.0 released, this is a major release in the ActiveMQ
     "classic" roadmap. It brings JDK11 support, Spring 5 upgrade (Spring 4
     is now deprecated), Log4j2 update (instead of log4j1 in previous
     releases), and bunch of other improvements.
##### ActiveMQ 5.18.0 development planning has started. The work we started
    around JMS 2 support has been postponed to ActiveMQ 5.18.0 in order to
    give us time to clean tests and review.

## Community Health:
The PMC recently voted in three new committers to the committee. Releases
continue unabated and discussions on the mailing list are positive and moving
in the right direction.
